Beneath the sky's eternal dome,  
Through valleys deep, the winds do roam.  
A river flows, both vast and true,  
Its currents weaving old and new.  

The stars, like sparks in velvet night,  
Have watched our dreams take fleeting flight.  
From ancient caves to cities high,  
Weâ€™ve chased the whispers of the sky.  

With hands of stone and hearts of fire,  
We built the world, climbed ever higher.  
Yet through it all, the song remains,  
Of love, of loss, and fleeting gains.  

The river runs, it cannot cease,  
Its song of chaos and of peace.  
And in its flow, we find our place,  
A fleeting moment, boundless grace.
